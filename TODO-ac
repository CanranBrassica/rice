rice/Makefile.am - should include files and sources be searched for or
explicitly listed?
pkgconfig support?
why does doxygen check for perl?
don't append -I../rice to CPPFLAGS when building tests (shouldn't depend
on relative location within build tree)
print ruby config options as they are found
should PACKAGE_NAME et al be put into config.hpp?
